1) The data is assumed to be kept in DATA_FOLDER defined in constants.py.
2) Run calOrientation.py to run the algorithm and plot the predicted Euler angles against the ground truth of Vicon.
3) Making panorama is achieved through one of the following functions - createPanoramaFromViconData(), createPanoramaFromPredictions(timestamps, filterResult, camFileName). They simply need to be uncommented in the code if you wish to create the panorama.
